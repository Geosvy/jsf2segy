Program jsf2segy extracts chirp subbottom data from an Edgetech .jsf formatted file.

The .jsf file can contain any combination of subbottom and side scan sonar data or other data as described
in Edgetech JSF Data File Description 1.20. jsf2segy will create an SEG Y file from jsf subbottom data and header records.
The SEG Y rev 1 Data Exchange Release 1.0 May 2002 is described a publication available
at https://seg.org/Publications/SEG-Technical-Standards.

jsf2segy will now (as of 5 November 2018) allow record length changes in the subbottom data.
If a record length change is detected, the current .sgy file is closed and a new .sgy file started.

Please note: the jsf format represents navigation data in one of three formats that are not quite
compatable with any SEGY trace header descriptors.

jsf bytes 80 -> 83 are described as "X in millimeters or decimeters or Longitude in Minutes of Arc / 10000 (INT32).

jsf bytes 84 -> 87 are described as "Y in millimeters or decimeters or Latitude in 0.0001 Minutes of Arc (INT32).

jsf bytes 88 -> 89 are described as "Coordinate Units: 1 = X, Y in millimeters, 2 =  Longitude, Latitude in
minutes of arc times 10-4, 3 = X,Y in decimeters.

jsf bytes 136 -> 139 are defined as Depth in Millimeters. The values represent the pressure depth of the vehicle in the water column.
jsf bytes 136 -> 139 are placed in Segy Rev 1 bytes 41 -> 44 and 45 -> 48.

jsf bytes 144 -> 147 are defined as Altitude in Millimeters. The value represents the water depth below the vehicle.
jsf bytes 144 -> 147 are placed in Segy Rev 1 trace header bytes 61 -> 64 and bytes 65 -> 68.
I believe the vehicle water depth is only valid if Discover is bottom tracking.

Other programs of interest:

lstjsf: lists the number of subbottom and sidescan records, lists selected parts of sidescan or subbottom jsf headers.

jsfmesgtype: lists the jsf message type and message type count of a given Edgetech .jsf file.
